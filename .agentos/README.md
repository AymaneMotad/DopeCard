# Agent OS Configuration

This directory contains the Agent OS (Spec-Driven Development) configuration and documentation for the dope-card project.

## Structure

- **standards/** - Coding standards and conventions
- **product/** - Product vision, roadmap, and use cases
- **specs/** - Feature specifications and implementation guidelines
- **ui-elements/** - UI design patterns and visual references
- **tasks/** - Task tracking files

## Quick Start

1. Review standards in `standards/` before starting development
2. Check product roadmap in `product/roadmap.md`
3. Read relevant specs in `specs/` before implementing features
4. Reference UI elements in `ui-elements/` for design guidance
5. Create tasks in `tasks/` to track work

## Integration Guide

See `AGENTOS_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` in the project root for a complete guide on integrating Agent OS into existing projects.

## Maintenance

- Update specs when code changes
- Keep roadmap current
- Review standards periodically
- Document new features in specs
